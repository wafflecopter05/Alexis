ALEXIS
"Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis"

Idea/Product conceived by the brains of Blake Tucker and Stevie Robinson
UIs conceived by Tara Mendoza

Alexis will be a full-blown passive collaboration app in time, but for now, we have a simple login screen that accepts a username of "foo" and a password of "foopass" and moves to a problem view screen, which (in the future) will show a problem that a user can solve, a text box for a user to input a comment/solution, and a submit button. Right, the "Submit Answer" does nothing, but in the future, it will submit the user's input to a server.

Features to note include:
- Login screen that only accepts for username "foo" and password "foopass" (Shows UIAlert screen for failed login attempt)
- Keyboard automatically hides on login screen when text boxes lose focus (tapped outside of)
- Textbox placeholder for future problem statement area on problem view screen.
