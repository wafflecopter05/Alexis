ALEXIS
"Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis"

Idea/Product conceived by the brains of Blake Tucker and Stevie Robinson
UIs conceived by Tara Mendoza

Alexis is a full-blown passive collaboration app. At the moment, it allows a user to log from predetermined login values stored in a local dictionary. From there, a menu is presented with placeholder problem examples, and each problem type will display a unique problem screen.

Features to note include:
- Login screen that denies invalid values
- Table view of problems from an array
- The ability to distinguish between problem types based on the menu selection.
- Answers are only accepted if the answer field is filled with something; otherwise, it is rejected.
